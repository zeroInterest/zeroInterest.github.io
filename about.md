Welcome to **Zero Interest**, a blog about Economics and Finance. The name of this blog comes from a paper written by Marc R. Reinganum (you can read the full paper [here](https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/13/1/10)) in which he shows by means of economic theory the impossibility of the invention of cheap time travel machines. In this article, Reinganum exposes how by the principle of arbitrage costless time travel would bring the nominal rate of interest to zero, implying that the rate of exchange between today's and tomorrow's goods would be one-for-one.
Such reference is not fortuitous, but reflects the aim of this blog: divulgation of economic theory by means of literature with an innovative and unconventional approach.
