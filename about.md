Welcome to **Zero Interest**, my personal blog in which I write about economics, finance and computer science. My name is **Francesc Busquet**, I am originally from Girona, a small city located in the northeast of Catalonia, a city full of history and great gastronomy and I currently live in Sankt Gallen, another small city in the northeastern part of Switzerland.
I work as a data scientist and a doctoral research associate at the Institute of Behavioral Science and Technology (IBT) at the University of St. Gallen. My main research interest is to identify how different forms of data can be used to better understand consumers and users. Also, as part of my research I am working on automating different processes of data analysis for different forms of data, making data analysis more accessible to non-technical profiles.
On the personal side, I am an avid cook, a nature-lover and a passionate reader. Most of my free time I'm either hiking a trail in the forest, trying a new recipe or reading a good book.
I started this blog in 2021, for three main reasons: (1) as a way of conveying my views on the economy and financial markets, (2) as a way to share resources related to data analysis, especially tutorials and (3) as a means of organizing what I am learning and what I want to learn, and consequently, share it.
